# Currency Converter
This watchOS application that I built helps user to convert the currency. It lets the user decide which currencies they care about and how much to convert. This is a page based app. Hence, the user can convert a particular currency into more than one currency in one go. When the user taps on ‘GO’ what it does is that it fetches current conversion rate using the fixer.io service and brings back what we asked for. Then, it parses it and the user has the conversion in a nice tabular form that he/she can scroll through.

In this project, I learnt about using new interface components like a page based interface and how to run code in a background thread so that the interface doesn’t lock up. I also learnt to use slider control, picker control, colouring the user’s selection and parsing JSON.
